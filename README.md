# Band Website

This is the README file for a Laravel-based website 
for the "Plach√Ω host" band to share future concert information and videos. 
The website includes an administration panel for managing 
the content.

I plan to add more features as sharing photos, 
administration of menu items and newsletter for fans, and some
way for administrating users.
